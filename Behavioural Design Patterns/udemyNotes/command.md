# Command Pattern Notes

## 1. Problem Identification

In software development, you may encounter situations where you need to perform actions (**commands**) based on user input or system events.
The challenge arises when the actions must be executed at a later time or when you need to implement features like **undo/redo** functionalities.

---

## 2. Potential Bad Solution

A common but poor approach is to use long, tightly coupled methods that directly handle specific commands.
This results in:

* Bloated methods
* Lack of flexibility
* Code thatâ€™s hard to manage and extend

Using conditional statements to handle different commands leads to **complex, difficult-to-test code**.

---

## 3. Why Choose the Command Pattern?

The **Command Pattern** addresses these issues by **encapsulating a request as an object**.
This **decouples** the sender (the one requesting the action) from the receiver (the one executing the action).

### Benefits

* Allows actions to be parameterized with different requests
* Facilitates delayed execution of commands
* Supports operation queuing and history (for undo functionality)

---

## 4. Example and Detailed Reasoning

Consider a **ride-sharing application** where passengers can request different types of rides (standard, luxury, etc.).
Instead of having methods directly linked to ride types, you can create specific command classes for each ride type that implement a common interface.

### Example Code Structure (Java)

```java
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

class StandardRideCommand implements Command {
    public void execute() {
        // Logic for standard ride
    }
}

class LuxuryRideCommand implements Command {
    public void execute() {
        // Logic for luxury ride
    }
}
```

### Use Case

This design allows the application to dynamically create a command object (like `StandardRideCommand` or `LuxuryRideCommand`) based on user input.

This enables:

* Cleaner, modular code
* Easier future modifications
* Simple implementation of command history for **undo functionality**

---

## Summary

By applying the **Command Pattern**, the system:

* Remains **flexible**
* Adheres to the **Single Responsibility Principle**
* Improves overall **code maintainability** and **scalability**
